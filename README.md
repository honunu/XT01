## Philosophy of XT01
When we were little kids, we kept asking our parents,"mom, what is a car?","why the sky is blue?" Suddenly we grew up, and the way we interact with the world
change dramatically as we get older. Most of us stop asking why, and just take things as they are--grown ups do not ask silly questions. "The jobs should be done this way."
"Math should be hard." This is how we teach kids for the last century. Deductions, abductions, inductions are tools or we call methologies built inside each individual's head without ever changing for entire life. Few people ever doubt their beliefs. What majority do is copy others' behaviours and collect rewards. Civilizations grow by deploying replicable and repeatable successes. New experiences gradually built inside our subconsciousness without we even notice. Beliefs influence our behaviour, behaviour becomes habbit, habbit becomes destiny.
