## Philosophy of XT01
When we were little kids, we kept asking our parents,"mom, what is a car?","why the sky is blue?" The way we interact with the world
change dramatically as we grew older. Most of us stop asking why, and just take things as they are. The jobs should be done this way.
Deductions, abductions, inductions are tools or we call methologies built inside each individual without ever changing for entire life.
