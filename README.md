## Philosophy of XT01
When we were little kids, we kept asking our parents,"mom, what is a car?","why the sky is blue?" But we grew up, and the way we interact with the world
change dramatically as we get older. Most of us stop asking why, and just take things as they are. The jobs should be done this way.
Math should be hard. The world should work this way. Deductions, abductions, inductions are tools or we call methologies built inside each individual's head without ever changing for entire life. New experiences gradually built inside our subconsciousness without we even notice. Beliefs influence our behaviour, behaviour becomes habbit, habbit becomes destiny.
