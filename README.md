## Philosophy of XT01
When we were little kids, we kept asking our parents,"mom, what is a car?","why the sky is blue?" Suddenly we grew up, and the way we interact with the world
change dramatically as we get older. Most of us stop asking why, and just take things as they are, grown ups do not ask silly questions. "The jobs should be done this way."
"Math should be hard." This is how we teach kids for the last century. Deductions, abductions, inductions are tools or we call methologies built inside each individual's head without ever changing for entire life. Few people ever doubt their beliefs. What majority do is copy others' behaviours and collect rewards. Civilizations grow by deploying replicable and repeatable successes. New experiences gradually built inside our subconsciousness without we even notice. Beliefs influence our behaviour, behaviour becomes habbit, habbit becomes destiny. 

I encourage you to take a closer look into your actions, even as simple as drinking water, you may find pretty interesting things happen that we never realize. We make some assumptions when we grab the glass. 
To make things simple, we define the glass to hold tap boiled water, 80% filled.
1. We assume the upper region of the glass is not that hot for our hand to grab.
2. We assume the liquid inside flow like water.
3. We assume the water is drinkable.
4. We assume the glass will not break when we grab it.

Animals also make assumptions. I was watching a cat walking with her child one afternoon. The kitten's mother does not walk alongside with her child. She walks a few meters before her child catches up. The kitten won't walk unless its mother proves it's safe. I stepped forward and cut in between them before the kitten reached its mom. The kitten stared at me, scared, waiting for a chance to move.

Normal person wouldn'd find their behaviors amazing, but I was stunned. The mother assumed she could protect her kitten, so she walked in front, but apparently I could easily took the kitten away, she had not chance of protecting her child against me. This is much like human behaviours when a boy holds a girl's hand, leading the girl into unknown areas. 

Some basic logics are universal among living creatures, especially those related to primitive emotions. 

### What is XT01
XT01 is a tool to break down behaviours.
