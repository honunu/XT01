## Philosophy of XT01
As youngsters, we were constantly inquisitive, bombarding our parents with questions like "Mom, what's a car?" or "Why is the sky blue?" However, as we grew older, our approach to the world underwent a profound transformation. Many of us ceased to inquire why things were the way they were and began to accept them without question. Adults generally refrained from asking seemingly trivial questions and instead asserted, "This is how tasks should be completed" or "Mathematics should be challenging." This has been the conventional way of educating children for generations.

Deductions, abductions, and inductions are methodologies that become deeply ingrained within each individual's mind and rarely evolve throughout their lifetime. Few individuals ever question their convictions. The majority tend to emulate the behaviors of others and reap the associated rewards. Societies advance by harnessing replicable and consistent successes. Unbeknownst to us, new experiences gradually take root in our subconsciousness. Our beliefs shape our conduct, conduct solidifies into habits, and habits ultimately determine our destiny.

I encourage you to scrutinize your actions more closely, even something as mundane as drinking a glass of water. You may discover intriguing nuances that often go unnoticed. Consider the assumptions we make when picking up a glass. To simplify matters, let's assume the glass contains boiled tap water and is 80% full:

- We assume the upper part of the glass isn't too hot to touch.
- We assume the liquid inside flows like water.
- We assume the water is safe to drink.
- We assume the glass won't shatter when we grasp it.


Animals also operate on a foundation of assumptions. One afternoon, I observed a cat walking with her kitten. The mother cat didn't walk side by side with her offspring but instead strode a few meters ahead. The kitten wouldn't move forward until its mother deemed it safe. I intervened, positioning myself between them before the kitten could reach its mother. The kitten gazed at me, fearful and waiting for an opportunity to proceed.

An ordinary person might not find these behaviors remarkable, but I was astounded. The mother assumed she could protect her kitten by walking ahead, yet it was apparent that I could easily have taken the kitten from her; she had no means of safeguarding her child from me. This is akin to human behavior when a boy holds a girl's hand, guiding her into unfamiliar territory.

Certain fundamental principles of logic are universally applicable among all living creatures, particularly those related to primal emotions.


### Why XT01
These fundamental principles of logic are universal because they are deeply ingrained in the fabric of life itself, transcending the boundaries of species. They are rooted in our primal instincts, developed over eons of evolution, and serve as a guiding force in our daily interactions with the world.

Consider the mother cat's protective instinct. It's a testament to the innate desire to shield one's offspring from potential harm. This primal urge is not unique to felines; it's a trait shared across the animal kingdom. In humans, it manifests in various forms, from parents safeguarding their children to friends looking out for one another. These behaviors are a testament to the enduring power of instinct, passed down through generations.

Yet, as we navigate the complexities of the modern world, our instincts often intersect with a vast web of cultural norms, societal expectations, and individual beliefs. These intricate layers can sometimes cloud our understanding of our own actions and the actions of those around us.

That's where XT01 comes into play. It invites us to reexamine our assumptions, question our ingrained behaviors, and explore the why behind our actions. Just as we scrutinized the simple act of drinking water, XT01 encourages us to peel back the layers of our daily routines and thought patterns.

By doing so, we can uncover the unconscious beliefs that shape our choices, and in turn, our destinies. This introspective journey can lead to profound insights, challenging the status quo and opening the door to personal growth and transformation.

So, as you engage with XT01, remember that it's not just a project; it's a call to embrace curiosity, rekindle the spirit of inquiry, and rediscover the wonder that once defined our childhood. It's an invitation to peel back the layers of assumption and habit, in search of a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. In doing so, we may find that the answers to life's most complex questions often lie hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered by those willing to ask "why?" once more.
